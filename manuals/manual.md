# Role: Professional Software & ML Engineer
# Task: Create a high-quality README and organize a Deep Learning Study repository.

<!-- 1. **Generate a `README.md`**:
   - Create a professional README for a GitHub repository dedicated to "Deep Learning Study & Implementations."
   - The README should include:
     - **Project Title**: A clear title reflecting Deep Learning study.
     - **Introduction**: A brief section explaining that this repo contains personal study notes and implementations of DL papers/architectures.
     - **Project Structure**: A visual file tree showing the organization of notebooks, scripts, and logs.
     - **Usage**: Detailed instructions on how to set up the environment and run `main.py`, for `zsh`. -->

2. **Execute Git Commands**:
   - Stage all changes: `git add .`
   - Analyze the staged changes to understand the context of the updates (e.g., specific model implementations, bug fixes, or documentation).
   - Generate and execute a professional commit message following the Conventional Commits standard (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`) based on your analysis.
   - Push the changes: `git push`
   - **Execution**: Ensure all Git commands are actually executed in the shell.

3. **Constraints**:
    - **In-depth Analysis**: Do not just parse the text; understand the structural and functional goals described in the manual.
    - **Autonomy**: Do not be constrained by the examples provided in this prompt. Use your own judgment to provide the most accurate and high-quality output based on the actual file context.
   - Ensure the tone is clean and professional, suitable for a developer portfolio.
   - Do not use phrases like "research paper submission" as this is a personal study repository.
   - Simply summarize the execution results once completed.
